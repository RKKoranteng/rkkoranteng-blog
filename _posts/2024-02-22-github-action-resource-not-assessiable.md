## Issue
I ran into this issue when creating my first GitHub Actions release using `actions@create-release`{: .filepath}.

## Cause
When you delete a repository and recreate it with the same name, it is possible that some settings or permissions related to the integration (GitHub Actions) are not properly updated.

## Solution
Enable the workflow integration.

Go to the repository's settings, navigate to the "Actions" and select "General"

![github actions integration error](2024-02-22-github-action-resource-not-assessiable-step1.png){: .shadow }{: .dark }

Scroll down to the "Workflow permissions", select "Read and write permissions", then click "Save". This can help refresh the integration's access to the repository.
