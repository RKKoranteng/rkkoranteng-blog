As explained earlier, the term 'Sprint' is used to signify short time period (typically two week period) when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work. Sprints are at the very heart of scrum.

The term sprint ceremony comes from the concept of celebrating key milestones within the sprint. However, they're less about celebrations and more about establishing consistent checkpoints in a project’s lifecycle.

These ceremonies are essentially meetings when the scrum team meets to plan work, discuss work in progress, gather feedback, and more. Here're the sprint cermeonies:

- ✅ **Sprint planning :** identify work to be completed during the sprint
- ✅ **Daily stand-up :** update on task progress
- ✅ **Sprint review :** demonstrate the work completed and gather feedback from stakeholders
- ✅ **Sprint retrospective :** discuss what went well and what needs to be improved
- ✅ **Backlog refinement grooming :** review, rank, and edit the backlog
