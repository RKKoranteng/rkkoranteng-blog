Let's take a closer look at the Backlog Refinement ceremony inorder to better understand what happens, who's involved, and what the expected outcomes are.

## 1. What's a backlog refinement
Backlog refinement is an ongoing process where the scrum team reviews, updates, and prioritizes items in the product backlog to ensure they are ready for future sprints. Backlog refinement was previously called "backlog grooming", but the name was changed because "grooming" became considered inappropriate and is no longer widely accepted in many organizations.

## 2. When does it occur?
Backlog refinement is not a single event, but rather an ongoing activity that happens regularly throughout the sprint (often as a weekly or mid-sprint session). It's important to note that formal scrum ceremony but is recommended to prevent sprint planning from becoming overwhelming.

## 4. How long is this meeting
The backlog refinement meeting is usually 1 hour on a weekly or mid-sprint basis, but it can be longer for bigger sprints.
