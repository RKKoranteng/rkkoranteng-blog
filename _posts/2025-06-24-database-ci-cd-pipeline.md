## Problem
In today's fast-paced business environment, many companies struggle to promote database changes to production quickly and safely. Database changes often remain locked in manual processes, isolated from modern CI/CD practices.

## Impact
This gap leads to:

- Delays in delivering new features
- Increased risk of human error in production deployments
- A disconnect between dev and ops teams

## Solution
There's a better way - something secure, automated, and developer-friendly. Here's a Azure DevOps CI/CD pipeline that:

- Validates database changes using Liquibase
- Automates deployments to Dev, Staging, and Production
- Enforces approval gates and rollback previews
- Promotes changes safely to production
- Requires no DBA intervention for routine changes

## Outcome
Implementing this solution allows:

- Developers to commit database changes and see them deployed to Dev within minutes
- Promotion to Production is fully automated but gated for approvals
- Dev and Ops teams have visibility and traceability of every change
- DBAs are no longer bottlenecks - we're enablers of innovation
- The business can respond faster to customer needs and market changes
