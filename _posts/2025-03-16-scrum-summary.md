The purpose of Scrum is to help teams deliver high-quality products iteratively by promoting collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement.

## 1. Benefits of Scrum

- ✅ Faster delivery: Delivers value incrementally with shorter sprint cycles.  
- ✅ Improved Collaboration: Promotes teamwork and communication.  
- ✅ Increased flexibility: Adapts quickly to changing requirements.  
- ✅ Transparency: Provides visibility into progress and challenges.  
- ✅ Customer satisfaction: Regular feedback ensures alignment with user needs.  
- ✅ Continuous improvement:  Retrospectives drive process enhancements.  

Scrum empowers teams to deliver better products efficiently! 🚀

## 2. Scrum Team Summary
The Scrum Team collaborates to deliver high-quality work in each sprint
Here's who's makes up the scum team.

- 👉 Developers:  Build, test, and deliver the product increment.  
- 👉 Product owner:  Manages the backlog and ensures the team delivers value aligned with business goals.  
- 👉 Scrum Master:  Facilitates Scrum processes, removes blockers, and promotes continuous improvement.  

## 3. Scrum Calendar Summary
A scrum calendar is filled with meetings referred to as "sprint ceremonies"
Here're the sprint ceremonies.

- 👉 Sprint planning: At the start of each sprint, the team plans and commits to work for the sprint.  
- 👉 Daily stand-up:  A 15-minute daily meeting where the team syncs, discusses progress, and addresses blockers.  
- 👉 Backlog refinement:  Ongoing activity to review, clarify, and prioritize backlog items for future sprints.  
- 👉 Sprint review:  At the end of the sprint, the team demonstrates completed work to stakeholders for feedback.  
- 👉 Sprint retrospective:  After the sprint review, the team reflects on processes and identifies improvements for the next sprint.  

This cycle repeats for each sprint to ensure continuous delivery and improvement.

## 4. How to Do Scrum Correctly
Here're some best practices when working in a scrum team.

- ✅ Define clear roles: Ensure the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developers understand their responsibilities.  
- ✅ Set realistic sprint goals:  Plan achievable sprint goals aligned with business value.  
- ✅ Maintain a refined backlog:  Regularly refine and prioritize backlog items.  
- ✅ Follow scrum events:  Conduct sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives consistently.  
- ✅ Adhere to definition of done (DoD):  Ensure work meets quality standards before considering it complete.  
- ✅ Promote team collaboration:  Foster open communication and teamwork.  
- ✅ Embrace continuous improvement:  Use retrospectives to refine processes and increase efficiency.  

Consistently applying these practices ensures successful Scrum implementation.

- ❌ Don’t change sprint scope midway: Avoid adding or modifying work during the sprint.  
- ❌ Don’t ignore backlog refinement: Unrefined backlog items create confusion and delays.  
- ❌ Don’t overcommit in sprints: Taking on too much leads to unfinished work.  
- ❌ Don’t neglect definition of done (DoD): Incomplete work lowers product quality.  
- ❌ Don’t delay feedback: Timely feedback ensures alignment and continuous improvement.  
- ❌ Don’t focus only on velocity: Prioritize delivering value over chasing speed.
