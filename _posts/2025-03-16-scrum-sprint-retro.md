Let's take a closer look at the Sprint Retrospective ceremony inorder to better understand what happens, who's involved, and what the expected outcomes are.

## 1. What's a sprint retro
The sprint retrospective (retro) is a meeting where the scrum team reflects on the recent sprint to identify what went well, what didn’t, and how to improve in the next sprint. Sprint retro differs from a sprint review because it focuses on continuous improvement of the process, rather than reviewing the product itself.

## 2. When does it occur?
The sprint retro occurs at the end of the sprint, after the sprint review. This ceremony should take place before the next sprint begins, allowing the team to identify and implement necessary process improvements.
